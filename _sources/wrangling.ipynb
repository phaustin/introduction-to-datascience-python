    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is centered around defining tidy data&mdash;a data format that is\n",
    "suitable for analysis&mdash;and the tools needed to transform raw data into this\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",

    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Define the term \"tidy data\".\n",
    "  - Discuss the advantages of storing data in a tidy data format.\n",
    "  - Define what vectors, lists, and data frames are in R, and describe how they relate to\n",
    "    each other.\n",
    "  - Describe the common types of data in R and their uses.\n",
    "  - Recall and use the following functions for their\n",

    "## Data frames, vectors, and lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapters \\@ref(intro) and \\@ref(reading), *data frames* were the focus:\n",
    "we learned how to import data into R as a data frame, and perform basic operations on data frames in R.\n",
    "In the remainder of this book, this pattern continues. The vast majority of tools we use will require \n",
    "that data are represented as a data frame in R. Therefore, in this section,\n",
    "we will dig more deeply into what data frames are and how they are represented in R.\n",
    "This knowledge will be helpful in effectively utilizing these objects in our data analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a data frame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame \\index{data frame!definition} is a table-like structure for storing data in R.  Data frames are\n",
    "important to learn about because most data that you will encounter in practice\n",
    "can be naturally stored as a table.  In order to define data frames precisely,\n",
    "we need to introduce a few technical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **variable:** a \\index{variable} characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured.\n",
    "- **observation:** all \\index{observation} of the measurements for a given entity.\n",
    "- **value:** a \\index{value} single measurement of a single variable for a given entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these definitions, a **data frame** is a tabular data structure in R\n",
    "that is designed to store observations, variables, and their values.\n",
    "Most commonly, each column in a data frame corresponds to a variable,\n",
    "and each row corresponds to an observation. For example, Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:02-obs) displays a data set of city populations. Here, the variables\n",
    "are \"region, year, population\"; each of these are properties that can be\n",
    "collected or measured.  The first observation is \"Toronto, 2016, 2235145\";\n",
    "these are the values that the three variables take for the first entity in the\n",
    "data set. There are 13 entities in the data set in total, corresponding to the\n",
    "13 rows in Figure \\@ref(fig:02-obs).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r 02-obs, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = \"center\", fig.pos = \"H\", out.extra=\"\", fig.cap = \"A data frame storing data regarding the population of various regions in Canada. In this example data frame, the row that corresponds to the observation for the city of Vancouver is colored yellow, and the column that corresponds to the population variable is colored blue.\", fig.retina = 2, out.width = \"100%\"}\n",

    "  image_crop(\"3632x700\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "R stores the columns of a data frame as either\n",
    "*lists* or *vectors*.  For example, the data frame in Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:02-vectors) has three vectors whose names are `region`, `year` and\n",
    "`population`. The next two sections will explain what lists and vectors are.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is a vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, **vectors** \\index{vector}\\index{atomic vector|see{vector}} are objects that can contain one or more elements. The vector\n",
    "elements are ordered, and they must all be of the same **data type**;\n",
    "R has several different basic data types, as shown in Table \\@ref(tab:datatype-table).\n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:02-vector) provides an example of a vector where all of the elements are\n",
    "of character type.\n",
    "You can create vectors in R using the `c` function  \\index{c function} (`c` stands for \"concatenate\").  For \n",
    "example, to create the vector `region` as shown in Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:02-vector), you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "year <- c(\"Toronto\", \"Montreal\", \"Vancouver\", \"Calgary\", \"Ottawa\")\n",
    "year\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Technically, these objects are called \"atomic vectors.\" In this book\n",
    "> we have chosen to call them \"vectors,\" which is how they are most commonly\n",
    "> referred to in the R community. To be totally precise, \"vector\" is an umbrella term that\n",
    "> encompasses both atomic vector and list objects in R. But this creates a \n",
    "> confusing situation where the term \"vector\" could \n",
    "> mean \"atomic vector\" *or* \"the umbrella term for atomic vector and list,\" \n",
    "> depending on context. Very confusing indeed! So to keep things simple, in \n",
    "> this book we *always* use the term \"vector\" to refer to \"atomic vector.\" \n",
    "> We encourage readers who are enthusiastic to learn more to read the\n",
    "> Vectors chapter of *Advanced R* [@wickham2019advanced].\n",

    "It is important in R to make sure you represent your data with the correct type. \n",
    "Many of the `tidyverse` functions we use in this book treat \n",
    "the various data types differently. You should use integers and double types\n",
    "(which both fall under the \"numeric\" umbrella type) to represent numbers and perform\n",
    "arithmetic. Doubles are more common than integers in R, though; for instance, a double data type is the\n",
    "default when you create a vector of numbers using `c()`, and when you read in\n",
    "whole numbers via `read_csv`. Characters are used to represent data that should\n",
    "be thought of as \"text\", such as words, names, paths, URLs, and more. Factors help us\n",
    "encode variables that represent *categories*; a factor variable takes one of a discrete\n",
    "set of values known as *levels* (one for each category). The levels can be ordered or unordered.  Even though\n",
    "factors can sometimes *look* like characters, they are not used to represent\n",

    "internally stores factors using integers! There are other basic data types in R, such as *raw*\n",
    "and *complex*, but we do not use these in this textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists \\index{list} are also objects in R that have multiple, ordered elements.\n",
    "Vectors and lists differ by the requirement of element type\n",
    "consistency. All elements within a single vector must be of the same type (e.g.,\n",

    "### What does this have to do with data frames?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame \\index{data frame!definition} is really a special kind of list that follows two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each element itself must either be a vector or a list. \n",
    "2. Each element (vector or list) must have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all columns in a data frame need to be of the same type. \n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:02-dataframe) shows a data frame where\n",
    "the columns are vectors of different types.\n",
    "But remember: because the columns in this example are *vectors*, \n",
    "the elements must be the same data type *within each column.* \n",
    "On the other hand, if our data frame had *list* columns, there would be no such requirement.\n",
    "It is generally much more common to use *vector* columns, though, \n",
    "as the values for a single variable are usually all of the same type.\n",
    "\n",

    "features and benefits over the built-in data frame object. These include the\n",
    "ability to add useful attributes (such as grouping, which we will discuss later)\n",
    "and more predictable type preservation when subsetting. \n",

    "## Tidy data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways a tabular data set can be organized. This chapter will focus\n",
    "on introducing the **tidy data** \\index{tidy data!definition} format of organization and how to make your raw\n",
    "(and likely messy) data tidy. A tidy data frame satisfies \n",
    "the following three criteria [@wickham2014tidy]:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - each row is a single observation,\n",
    "  - each column is a single variable, and\n",
    "  - each value is a single cell (i.e., its entry in the data\n",
    "    frame is not shared with another value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:02-tidy-image) demonstrates a tidy data set that satisfies these \n",
    "three criteria. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good reasons for making sure your data are tidy as a first step in your analysis.\n",
    "The most important is that it is a single, consistent format that nearly every function\n",
    "in the `tidyverse` recognizes. No matter what the variables and observations \n",
    "in your data represent, as long as the data frame \\index{tidy data!arguments for}\n",
    "is tidy, you can manipulate it, plot it, and analyze it using the same tools.\n",
    "If your data is *not* tidy, you will have to write special bespoke code\n",
    "in your analysis that will not only be error-prone, but hard for others to understand.\n",
    "Beyond making your analysis more accessible to others and less error-prone, tidy data\n",
    "is also typically easy for humans to interpret. Given these benefits,\n",
    "it is well worth spending the time to get your data into a tidy format\n",
    "upfront. Fortunately, there are many well-designed `tidyverse` data\n",
    "cleaning/wrangling tools to help you easily tidy your data. Let's explore them\n",
    "below!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Is there only one shape for tidy data for a given data set? Not\n",
    "> necessarily! It depends on the statistical question you are asking and what\n",
    "> the variables are for that question. For tidy data, each variable should be\n",
    "> its own column. So, just as it's essential to match your statistical question\n",
    "> with the appropriate data analysis tool, it's important to match your\n",
    "> statistical question with the appropriate variables and ensure they are\n",

    "### Tidying up: going from wide to long using `pivot_longer`\n",
    "\n",
    "One task that is commonly performed to get data into a tidy format \\index{pivot\\_longer}\n",
    "is to combine values that are stored in separate columns, \n",
    "but are really part of the same variable, into one.\n",
    "Data is often stored this way \n",
    "because this format is sometimes more intuitive for human readability \n",
    "and understanding, and humans create data sets.\n",
    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:02-wide-to-long), \n",
    "the table on the left is in an untidy, \"wide\" format because the year values \n",
    "(2006, 2011, 2016) are stored as column names. \n",
    "And as a consequence, \n",
    "the values for population for the various cities \n",
    "over these years are also split across several columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, this table is easy to read, which is why you will often find data\n",
    "stored in this wide format.  However, this format is difficult to work with\n",
    "when performing data visualization or statistical analysis using R.  For\n",
    "example, if we wanted to find the latest year it would be challenging because\n",
    "the year values are stored as column names instead of as values in a single\n",
    "column.  So before we could apply a function to find the latest year (for\n",
    "example, by using `max`), we would have to first extract the column names\n",
    "to get them as a vector and then apply a function to extract the latest year.\n",
    "The problem only gets worse if you would like to find the value for the\n",
    "population for a given region for the latest year.  Both of these tasks are\n",
    "greatly simplified once the data is tidied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem with data in this format is that we don't know what the\n",
    "numbers under each year actually represent. Do those numbers represent\n",
    "population size? Land area? It's not clear. \n",
    "To solve both of these problems, \n",
    "we can reshape this data set to a tidy data format \n",
    "by creating a column called \"year\" and a column called\n",
    "\"population.\" This transformation&mdash;which makes the data\n",
    "\"longer\"&mdash;is shown as the right table in\n",

    "2)  filter for rows where another column, `other_col`, is more than 5, and\n",
    "3)  select only the new column `new_col` for those rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of performing these three steps is to just write \n",

    "\n",
    "``` {r eval = FALSE}\n",
    "output_1 <- mutate(data, new_col = old_col * 2)\n",
    "output_2 <- filter(output_1, other_col > 5)\n",
    "output <- select(output_2, new_col)\n",

    "into thinking the named `output_1` and `output_2` objects are important for some\n",
    "reason, while they are just temporary intermediate computations. Further, the\n",
    "reader has to look through and find where `output_1` and `output_2` are used in\n",
    "each subsequent line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option for doing this would be to *compose* the functions:\n",

    "really long line of code to read in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pipe operator* (`|>`) solves this problem, resulting in cleaner and\n",
    "easier-to-follow code. `|>` is built into R so you don't need to load any\n",

    "\n",
    "The pipe operator (|>) can be used with any function in R. \n",

    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "large_region_lang <- filter(tidy_lang, most_at_home > 10000) |>\n",

    "- As we mentioned earlier, `tidyverse` is actually an *R\n",
    "  meta package*: it installs and loads a collection of R packages that all\n",
    "  follow the tidy data philosophy we discussed above. One of the `tidyverse`\n",
    "  packages is `dplyr`&mdash;a data wrangling workhorse. You have already met many\n",
    "  of `dplyr`'s functions \n",
    "  (`select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange`, `summarize`, and `group_by`). \n",
    "  To learn more about these functions and meet a few more useful\n",
    "  functions, we recommend you check out Chapters 5-9 of the [STAT545 online notes](https://stat545.com/).\n",
    "  of the data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R book.\n",
    "- The [`dplyr` R package documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) [@dplyr] is\n",
    "  another resource to learn more about the functions in this\n",
    "  chapter, the full set of arguments you can use, and other related functions.\n",
    "  The site also provides a very nice cheat sheet that summarizes many of the\n",
    "  data wrangling functions from this chapter.\n",
    "- Check out the [`tidyselect` R package page](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/index.html)\n",
    "  [@tidyselect] for a comprehensive list of `select` helpers. \n",
    "  These helpers can be used to choose columns in a data frame when paired with  the `select` function \n",
    "  (and other functions that use the `tidyselect` syntax, such as `pivot_longer`).\n",
    "  The [documentation for `select` helpers](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/select_helpers.html) \n",
    "  is a useful reference to find the helper you need for your particular problem.\n",
    "- *R for Data Science* [@wickham2016r] has a few chapters related to\n",
    "  data wrangling that go into more depth than this book. For example, the\n",
    "  [tidy data chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) covers tidy data,\n",
    "  `pivot_longer`/`pivot_wider` and `separate`, but also covers missing values\n",
    "  and additional wrangling functions (like `unite`). The [data\n",
    "  transformation chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) covers\n",
    "  `select`, `filter`, `arrange`, `mutate`, and `summarize`. And the [`map`\n",
    "  functions chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions)\n",
    "  provides more about the `map` functions.\n",
    "- You will occasionally encounter a case where you need to iterate over items\n",
    "  in a data frame, but none of the above functions are flexible enough to do\n",
    "  what you want. In that case, you may consider using [a for\n",
