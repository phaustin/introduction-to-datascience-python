    "## Overview \n",
    "Up to this point, we have solved all of our predictive problems&mdash;both classification\n",
    "and regression&mdash;using K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based approaches. In the context of regression, \n",
    "there is another commonly used method known as *linear regression*. This chapter provides an introduction\n",
    "to the basic concept of linear regression, shows how to use `tidymodels` to perform linear regression in R,\n",
    "and characterizes its strengths and weaknesses compared to KNN regression. The focus is, as usual,\n",
    "on the case where there is a single predictor and single response variable of interest; but the chapter\n",
    "concludes with an example using *multivariable linear regression* when there is more than one\n",
    "predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives \n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use R and `tidymodels` to fit a linear regression model on training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate the linear regression model on test data.\n",
    "* Compare and contrast predictions obtained from K-nearest neighbor regression to those obtained using linear regression from the same data set.\n",
    "* In R, overlay predictions from linear regression on a scatter plot of data using `geom_smooth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the previous chapter, we noted some limitations of KNN regression.\n",
    "While the method is simple and easy to understand, KNN regression does not\n",
    "predict well beyond the range of the predictors in the training data, and\n",
    "the method gets significantly slower as the training data set grows. \\index{regression!linear}\n",
    "Fortunately, there is an alternative to KNN regression&mdash;*linear regression*&mdash;that addresses\n",
    "both of these limitations. Linear regression is also very commonly \n",
    "used in practice because it provides an interpretable mathematical equation that describes\n",
    "the relationship between the predictor and response variables. In this first part of the chapter, we will focus on *simple* linear regression,\n",
    "which involves only one predictor variable and one response variable; later on, we will consider\n",
    " *multivariable* linear regression, which involves multiple predictor variables.\n",
    " Like KNN regression, simple linear regression involves\n",
    "predicting a numerical response variable (like race time, house price, or height);\n",
    "but *how* it makes those predictions for a new observation is quite different from KNN regression.\n",
    " Instead of looking at the K nearest neighbors and averaging\n",
    "over their values for a prediction, in simple linear regression, we create a \n",
    "straight line of best fit through the training data and then\n",
    "\"look up\" the prediction using the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Although we did not cover it in earlier chapters, there \n",
    "> is another popular method for classification called *logistic\n",
    "> regression* (it is used for classification even though the name, somewhat confusingly,\n",
    "> has the word \"regression\" in it). In logistic regression&mdash;similar to linear regression&mdash;you\n",
    "> \"fit\" the model to the training data and then \"look up\" the prediction for each new observation.\n",
    "> Logistic regression and KNN classification have an advantage/disadvantage comparison \n",
    "> similar to that of linear regression and KNN\n",
    "> regression. It is useful to have a good understanding of linear regression before learning about\n",
    "> logistic regression. After reading this chapter, see the \"Additional Resources\" section at the end of the\n",

    "Or what about *negative* 2,000 square feet? As it turns out, nothing in the formula breaks; linear\n",
    "regression will happily make predictions for crazy predictor values if you ask it to. But even though\n",
    "you *can* make these wild predictions, you shouldn't. You should only make predictions roughly within\n",
