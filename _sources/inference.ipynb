    "## Overview\n",
    "A typical data analysis task in practice is to draw conclusions about some\n",
    "unknown aspect of a population of interest based on observed data sampled from\n",
    "that population; we typically do not get data on the *entire* population.  Data\n",
    "analysis questions regarding how summaries, patterns, trends, or relationships\n",
    "in a data set extend to the wider population are called *inferential\n",
    "questions*. This chapter will start with the fundamental ideas of sampling from\n",
    "populations and then introduce two common techniques in statistical inference:\n",
    "*point estimation* and *interval estimation*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives \n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe real-world examples of questions that can be answered with statistical inference.\n",
    "* Define common population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion, standard deviation) that are often estimated using sampled data, and estimate these from a sample.\n",
    "* Define the following statistical sampling terms (population, sample, population parameter, point estimate, sampling distribution).\n",
    "* Explain the difference between a population parameter and a sample point estimate.\n",
    "* Use R to draw random samples from a finite population.\n",
    "* Use R to create a sampling distribution from a finite population.\n",
    "* Describe how sample size influences the sampling distribution.\n",
    "* Define bootstrapping.\n",
    "* Use R to create a bootstrap distribution to approximate a sampling distribution.\n",
    "* Contrast the bootstrap and sampling distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need sampling? \n",
    "We often need to understand how quantities we observe in a subset\n",
    "of data relate to the same quantities in the broader population. For example, suppose a\n",
    "retailer is considering selling iPhone accessories, and they want to estimate\n",
    "how big the market might be. Additionally, they want to strategize how they can\n",
    "market their products on North American college and university campuses. This\n",
    "retailer might formulate the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What proportion of all undergraduate students in North America own an iPhone?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above question, we are interested in making a conclusion about *all*\n",
    "undergraduate students in North America; this is referred to as the **population**. \\index{population} In\n",
    "general, the population is the complete collection of individuals or cases we\n",
    "are interested in studying.  Further, in the above question, we are interested\n",
    "in computing a quantity&mdash;the proportion of iPhone owners&mdash;based on\n",
    "the entire population. This proportion is referred to as a **population parameter**. \\index{population!parameter} In\n",
    "general, a population parameter is a numerical characteristic of the entire\n",
    "population. To compute this number in the example above, we would need to ask\n",
    "every single undergraduate in North America whether they own an iPhone. In\n",
    "practice, directly computing population parameters is often time-consuming and\n",
    "costly, and sometimes impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more practical approach would be to make measurements for a **sample**, i.e., a \\index{sample}\n",
    "subset of individuals collected from the population. We can then compute a\n",
    "**sample estimate**&mdash;a numerical characteristic of the sample&mdash;that \\index{sample!estimate}\n",
    "estimates the population parameter. For example, suppose we randomly selected\n",
    "ten undergraduate students across North America (the sample) and computed the\n",
    "proportion of those students who own an iPhone (the sample estimate). In that\n",
    "case, we might suspect that proportion is a reasonable estimate of the\n",
    "proportion of students who own an iPhone in the entire population.  Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:11-population-vs-sample) illustrates this process.\n",
    "In general, the process of using a sample to make a conclusion about the\n",
    "broader population from which it is taken is referred to as **statistical inference**. \n",
    "\\index{inference}\\index{statistical inference|see{inference}}\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r 11-population-vs-sample, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = \"Population versus sample.\", out.width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "knitr::include_graphics(\"img/population_vs_sample.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that proportions are not the *only* kind of population parameter we might\n",
    "be interested in. For example, suppose an undergraduate student studying at the University\n",
    "of British Columbia in Canada is looking for an apartment\n",
    "to rent. They need to create a budget, so they want to know something about\n",
    "studio apartment rental prices in Vancouver, BC. This student might \n",
    "formulate the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the average price-per-month of studio apartment rentals in Vancouver, Canada?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the population consists of all studio apartment rentals in Vancouver, and the\n",
    "population parameter is the *average price-per-month*. Here we used the average\n",
    "as a measure of the center to describe the \"typical value\" of studio apartment\n",
    "rental prices. But even within this one example, we could also be interested in\n",
    "many other population parameters. For instance, we know that not every studio\n",
    "apartment rental in Vancouver will have the same price per month. The student\n",
    "might be interested in how much monthly prices vary and want to find a measure\n",
    "of the rentals' spread (or variability), such as the standard deviation. Or perhaps the\n",
    "student might be interested in the fraction of studio apartment rentals that\n",
    "cost more than \\$1000 per month. The question we want to answer will help us\n",
    "determine the parameter we want to estimate. If we were somehow able to observe\n",
    "the whole population of studio apartment rental offerings in Vancouver, we\n",
    "could compute each of these numbers exactly; therefore, these are all\n",
    "population parameters. There are many kinds of observations and population\n",
    "parameters that you will run into in practice, but in this chapter, we will\n",
    "focus on two settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using categorical observations to estimate the proportion of a category\n",
    "2. Using quantitative observations to estimate the average (or mean)\n",
    "\n",

    "1. A point estimate is a single value computed using a sample from a population (e.g., a mean or proportion).\n",
    "2. The sampling distribution of an estimate is the distribution of the estimate for all possible samples of a fixed size from the same population.\n",
    "3. The shape of the sampling distribution is usually bell-shaped with one peak and centered at the population mean or proportion.\n",
    "4. The spread of the sampling distribution is related to the sample size. As the sample size increases, the spread of the sampling distribution decreases. \n",

    "## Bootstrapping \n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "*Why all this emphasis on sampling distributions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous section that we could compute a **point estimate** of a\n",
    "population parameter using a sample of observations from the population. And\n",
    "since we constructed examples where we had access to the population, we could\n",
    "evaluate how accurate the estimate was, and even get a sense of how much the\n",
    "estimate would vary for different samples from the population.  But in real\n",
    "data analysis settings, we usually have *just one sample* from our population\n",
    "and do not have access to the population itself. Therefore we cannot construct\n",
    "the sampling distribution as we did in the previous section. And as we saw, our\n",
    "sample estimate's value can vary significantly from the population parameter.\n",
    "So reporting the point estimate from a single sample alone may not be enough.\n",
    "We also need to report some notion of *uncertainty* in the value of the point\n",
    "estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we cannot construct the exact sampling distribution without\n",
    "full access to the population. However, if we could somehow *approximate* what \n",
    "the sampling distribution would look like for a sample, we could \n",
    "use that approximation to then report how uncertain our sample\n",
    "point estimate is (as we did above with the *exact* sampling\n",
    "distribution). There are several methods to accomplish this; in this book, we \n",
    "will use the \\index{bootstrap} *bootstrap*. We will discuss **interval estimation** and \n",
    "construct \\index{confidence interval}\\index{interval|see{confidence interval}} \n",
    "**confidence intervals** using just a single sample from a population. A \n",
    "confidence interval is a range of plausible values for our population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key idea. First, if you take a big enough sample, it *looks like*\n",
    "the population. Notice the histograms' shapes for samples of different sizes\n",
    "taken from the population in Figure \\@ref(fig:11-example-bootstrapping0). We\n",
    "see that the sample’s distribution looks like that of the population for a\n",
    "large enough sample."

    "- Chapters 7 to 10 of *Modern Dive* [@moderndive] provide a great\n",

    "  sampling and bootstrapping using `tidyverse` and `infer` in a slightly more\n",
    "  in-depth manner than the present chapter. Chapters 9 and 10 take the next step\n",
    "  beyond the scope of this chapter and begin to provide some of the initial\n",
    "  mathematical underpinnings of inference and more advanced applications of the\n",
    "  concept of inference in testing hypotheses and performing regression. This\n",

    "  provide a good next step after *Modern Dive*. Although it is still certainly\n",
    "  an introductory text, things get a bit more mathematical here. Depending on\n",
    "  your background, you may actually want to start going through Chapters 1 to 3\n",
    "  first, where you will learn some fundamental concepts in probability theory.\n",
