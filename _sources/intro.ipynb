    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides an introduction to data science and the R programming language.\n",
    "The goal here is to get your hands dirty right from the start! We will walk through an entire data analysis,\n",
    "and along the way introduce different types of data analysis question, some fundamental programming \n",
    "concepts in R, and the basics of loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. In the following chapters, we will\n",
    "dig into each of these steps in much more detail; but for now, let's jump in to see how much we can do \n",
    "with data science!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the different types of data analysis question and categorize a question into the correct type.\n",
    "- Load the `tidyverse` package into R.\n",
    "- Read tabular data with `read_csv`.\n",
    "- Use `?` to access help and documentation tools in R.\n",
    "- Create new variables and objects in R using the assignment symbol.\n",
    "- Create and organize subsets of tabular data using `filter`, `select`, `arrange`, and `slice`.\n",
    "- Visualize data with a `ggplot` bar plot.\n",

    "## Canadian languages data set\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, \\index{Canadian languages} we will walk through a full analysis of a data set relating to\n",
    "languages spoken at home by Canadian residents. Many Indigenous peoples exist in Canada \n",
    "with their own cultures and languages; these languages are often unique to Canada and not spoken\n",
    "anywhere else in the world [@statcan2018mothertongue]. Sadly, colonization has\n",
    "led to the loss of many of these languages. For instance, generations of\n",
    "children were not allowed to speak their mother tongue (the first language an\n",
    "individual learns in childhood) in Canadian residential schools. Colonizers\n",
    "also renamed places they had \"discovered\" [@wilson2018].  Acts such as these\n",
    "have significantly harmed the continuity of Indigenous languages in Canada, and\n",
    "some languages are considered \"endangered\" as few people report speaking them. \n",
    "To learn more, please see *Canadian Geographic*'s article, \"Mapping Indigenous Languages in \n",
    "Canada\" [@walker2017], \n",

    "[the `canlang` R data package](https://ttimbers.github.io/canlang/) \n",
    "[@timbers2020canlang], which has\n",
    "population language data collected during the 2016 Canadian census [@cancensus2016]. \n",
    "In this data, there are 214 languages recorded, each having six different properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `category`: Higher-level language category, describing whether the language is an Official Canadian language, an Aboriginal (i.e., Indigenous) language, or a Non-Official and Non-Aboriginal language.\n",
    "2. `language`: The name of the language.\n",
    "3. `mother_tongue`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as their mother tongue. Mother tongue is generally defined as the language someone was exposed to since birth.\n",
    "4. `most_at_home`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as being spoken most often at home.\n",
    "5. `most_at_work`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as being used most often at work.\n",
    "6. `lang_known`: Number of Canadian residents who reported knowledge of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the census, more than 60 Aboriginal languages were reported\n",
    "as being spoken in Canada. Suppose we want to know which are the most common;\n",
    "then we might ask the following question, which we wish to answer using our data: \n",
    "\n",
    "*Which ten Aboriginal languages were most often reported in 2016 as mother\n",
    "tongues in Canada, and how many people speak each of them?* \n",

    "> examples to concentrate on methods and fundamental concepts. But in real\n",
    "> life, you cannot and should not do data science without a domain expert.\n",
    "> Alternatively, it is common to practice data science in your own domain of\n",
    "> expertise! Remember that when you work with data, it is essential to think\n",

    "## Asking a question \n",
    "\n",
    "Every good data analysis begins with a *question*&mdash;like the\n",
    "above&mdash;that you aim to answer using data. As it turns out, there\n",
    "are actually a number of different *types* of question regarding data:\n",
    "descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal, and mechanistic,\n",
    "all of which are defined in Table \\@ref(tab:questions-table).\n",
    "Carefully formulating a question as early as possible in your analysis&mdash;and \n",

    "|Question type|    Description         |     Example        |\n",
    "|-------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Descriptive | A question that asks about summarized characteristics of a data set without interpretation (i.e., report a fact). | How many people live in each province and territory in Canada? |\n",
    "| Exploratory | A question that asks if there are patterns, trends, or relationships within a single data set. Often used to propose hypotheses for future study. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth in a set of data collected on 2,000 people living in Canada? |\n",
    "| Predictive | A question that asks about predicting measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). The focus is on what things predict some outcome, but not what causes the outcome. | What political party will someone vote for in the next Canadian election? |\n",
    "| Inferential | A question that looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set **and** also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth for all people living in Canada? |\n",
    "| Causal | A question that asks about whether changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor, on average, in the wider population. | Does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections? |\n",
    "| Mechanistic | A question that asks about the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends, or relationships (i.e., how does it happen?) | How does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections? |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, you will learn techniques to answer the \n",
    "first four types of question: descriptive, exploratory, predictive, and inferential; \n",
    "causal and mechanistic questions are beyond the scope of this book.\n",
    "In particular, you will learn how to apply the following analysis tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summarization:** \\index{summarization!overview} computing and reporting aggregated values pertaining to a data set. \n",
    "Summarization is most often used to answer descriptive questions,\n",
    "and can occasionally help with answering exploratory questions.\n",
    "For example, you might use summarization to answer the following question: \n",
    "*What is the average race time for runners in this data set?*\n",
    "Tools for summarization are covered in detail in Chapters \\@ref(reading)\n",
    "and \\@ref(wrangling), but appear regularly throughout the text.\n",
    "2. **Visualization:** \\index{visualization!overview} plotting data graphically. \n",
    "Visualization is typically used to answer descriptive and exploratory questions,\n",
    "but plays a critical supporting role in answering all of the types of question in Table \\@ref(tab:questions-table).\n",
    "For example, you might use visualization to answer the following question:\n",
    "*Is there any relationship between race time and age for runners in this data set?* \n",
    "This is covered in detail in Chapter \\@ref(viz), but again appears regularly throughout the book.\n",
    "3. **Classification:** \\index{classification!overview} predicting a class or category for a new observation.\n",
    "Classification is used to answer predictive questions.\n",
    "For example, you might use classification to answer the following question:\n",
    "*Given measurements of a tumor's average cell area and perimeter, is the tumor benign or malignant?*\n",
    "Classification is covered in Chapters \\@ref(classification) and \\@ref(classification2).\n",
    "4. **Regression:**  \\index{regression!overview} predicting a quantitative value for a new observation. \n",
    "Regression is also used to answer predictive questions.\n",
    "For example, you might use regression to answer the following question:\n",
    "*What will be the race time for a 20-year-old runner who weighs 50kg?*\n",
    "Regression is covered in Chapters \\@ref(regression1) and \\@ref(regression2).\n",
    "5. **Clustering:** \\index{clustering!overview} finding previously unknown/unlabeled subgroups in a\n",
    "data set. Clustering is often used to answer exploratory questions.\n",
    "For example, you might use clustering to answer the following question:\n",
    "*What products are commonly bought together on Amazon?*\n",
    "Clustering is covered in Chapter \\@ref(clustering).\n",
    "6. **Estimation:**  \\index{estimation!overview} taking measurements for a small number of items from a large group \n",
    " and making a good guess for the average or proportion for the large group. Estimation \n",
    "is used to answer inferential questions.\n",
    "For example, you might use estimation to answer the following question:\n",
    "*Given a survey of cellphone ownership of 100 Canadians, what proportion\n",
    "of the entire Canadian population own Android phones?* \n",
    "Estimation is covered in Chapter \\@ref(inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to Table \\@ref(tab:questions-table), our question about \n",
    "Aboriginal languages is an example of a *descriptive question*: we are\n",
    "summarizing the characteristics of a data set without further interpretation.\n",
    "And referring to the list above, it looks like we should use visualization\n",
    "and perhaps some summarization to answer the question. So in the remainder\n",
    "of this chapter, we will work towards making a visualization that shows \n",
    "us the ten most common Aboriginal languages in Canada and their associated counts,\n",
    "according to the 2016 census. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading a tabular data set\n",
    "A data set is, at its core essence, a structured collection of numbers and characters.\n",
    "Aside from that, there are really no strict rules; data sets can come in \n",
    "many different forms! Perhaps the most common form of data set that you will\n",
    "find in the wild, however, is *tabular data*\\index{tabular data}. Think spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel: tabular data are\n",
    "rectangular-shaped and spreadsheet-like, as shown in Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe). In this book, we will focus primarily on tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using R for data analysis in this book, the first step for us is to\n",
    "load the data into R. When we load tabular data into\n",
    "R, it is represented as a *data frame* object\\index{data frame!overview}. Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe) shows that an R data frame is very similar\n",
    "to a spreadsheet. We refer to the rows as \\index{observation} **observations**; these are the things that we\n",
    "collect the data on, e.g., voters, cities, etc. We refer to the columns as \\index{variable}\n",
    "**variables**; these are the characteristics of those observations, e.g., voters' political\n",
    "affiliations, cities' populations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = \"A spreadsheet versus a data frame in R.\", out.width=\"100%\", fig.retina = 2}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first kind of data file that we will learn how to load into R as a data\n",
    "frame is the *comma-separated values* format (`.csv` for short)\\index{comma-separated values|see{csv}}\\index{csv}.  These files\n",
    "have names ending in `.csv`, and can be opened and saved using common\n",
    "spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.  For example, the\n",
    "`.csv` file named `can_lang.csv` \n",
    "is included with [the code for this book](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience/tree/master/data).\n",

    "\n",
    "When we loaded the 2016 Canadian census language data\n",
    "using `read_csv`, we did not give this data frame a name. \n",
    "Therefore the data was just printed on the screen, \n",
    "and we cannot do anything else with it. That isn't very useful. \n",
    "What would be more useful would be to give a name \n",
    "to the data frame that `read_csv` outputs, \n",
    "so that we can refer to it later for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to assign a name to a value in R is via the *assignment symbol* `<-`. \n",
    "\\index{aaaassignsymb@\\texttt{<-}|see{assignment symbol}}\\index{assignment symbol}\n",
    "On the left side of the assignment symbol you put the name that you want\n",
    "to use, and on the right side of the assignment symbol\n",
    "you put the value that you want the name to refer to.\n",
    "Names can be used to refer to almost anything in R, such as numbers,\n",
    "words (also known as *strings* of characters), and data frames!\n",

    "Note that when \n",
    "we name something in R using the assignment symbol, `<-`, \n",
    "we do not need to surround the name we are creating  with quotes. This is \n",
    "because we are formally telling R that this special word denotes\n",

    "symbol&mdash;e.g., the file name `\"data/can_lang.csv\"` that we specified before, or `\"Alice\"` above&mdash;need \n",
    "to be surrounded by quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making the assignment, we can use the special name words we have created in\n",
    "place of their values. For example, if we want to do something with the value `3` later on, \n",
    "we can just use `my_number` instead. Let's try adding 2 to `my_number`; you will see that\n",
