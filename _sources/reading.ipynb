    "In this chapter, you’ll learn to read tabular data of various formats into R\n",
    "from your local device (e.g., your laptop) and the web. “Reading” (or “loading”)\n",
    "\\index{loading|see{reading}}\\index{reading!definition} is the process of\n",
    "converting data (stored as plain text, a database, HTML, etc.) into an object\n",
    "(e.g., a data frame) that R can easily access and manipulate. Thus reading data\n",
    "is the gateway to any data analysis; you won’t be able to analyze data unless\n",
    "you’ve loaded it first. And because there are many ways to store data, there\n",
    "are similarly many ways to read data into R. The more time you spend upfront\n",
    "matching the data reading method to the type of data you have, the less time\n",
    "you will have to devote to re-formatting, cleaning and wrangling your data (the\n",
    "second step to all data analyses). It’s like making sure your shoelaces are\n",
    "tied well before going for a run so that you don’t trip later on!\n",

    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the following:\n",
    "    - absolute file path\n",
    "    - relative file path\n",
    "    - **U**niform **R**esource **L**ocator (URL)\n",
    "- Read data into R using a relative path and a URL.\n",
    "- Compare and contrast the following functions:\n",
    "    - `read_csv` \n",
    "    - `read_tsv`\n",
    "    - `read_csv2`\n",
    "    - `read_delim`\n",
    "    - `read_excel`\n",
    "- Match the following `tidyverse` `read_*` function arguments to their descriptions:\n",
    "    - `file` \n",
    "    - `delim`\n",
    "    - `col_names`\n",
    "    - `skip`\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate `tidyverse` `read_*` function and function arguments to load a given plain text tabular data set into R.\n",
    "- Use `readxl` package's `read_excel` function and arguments to load a sheet from an excel file into R.\n",
    "- Connect to a database using the `DBI` package's `dbConnect` function.\n",
    "- List the tables in a database using the `DBI` package's `dbListTables` function.\n",
    "- Create a reference to a database table that is queriable using the `tbl` from the `dbplyr` package.\n",
    "- Retrieve data from a database query and bring it into R using the `collect` function from the `dbplyr` package.\n",
    "- Use `write_csv` to save a data frame to a `.csv` file.\n",
    "- (*Optional*) Obtain data using **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterfaces (APIs) and web scraping.\n",
    "    - Read HTML source code from a URL using the `rvest` package.\n",
    "    - Read data from the Twitter API using the `rtweet` package.\n",
    "    - Compare downloading tabular data from a plain text file (e.g., `.csv`), accessing data from an API, and scraping the HTML source code from a website.\n",

    "## Absolute and relative file paths\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will discuss the different functions we can use to import data\n",
    "into R, but before we can talk about *how* we read the data into R with these\n",
    "functions, we first need to talk about *where* the data lives. When you load a\n",
    "data set into R, you first need to tell R where those files live. The file\n",
    "could live on your  computer (*local*) \n",
    "\\index{location|see{path}} \\index{path!local, remote, relative, absolute} \n",
    "or somewhere on the internet (*remote*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The place where the file lives on your computer is called the \"path\". You can\n",
    "think of the path as directions to the file. There are two kinds of paths:\n",
    "*relative* paths and *absolute* paths. A relative path is where the file is\n",
    "with respect to where you currently are on the computer (e.g., where the file\n",
    "you're working in is). On the other hand, an absolute path is where the file is\n",
    "in respect to the computer's filesystem base (or root) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our computer's filesystem looks like the picture in Figure\n",
    "\\@ref(fig:file-system-for-export-to-intro-datascience), and we are working in a\n",
    "file titled `worksheet_02.ipynb`. If we want to \n",
    "read the `.csv` file named `happiness_report.csv` into R, we could do this\n",
    "using either a relative or an absolute path.  We show both choices\n",
    "below.\\index{Happiness Report}\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r file-system-for-export-to-intro-datascience, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = \"Example file system.\", fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "knitr::include_graphics(\"img/filesystem.jpeg\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading `happiness_report.csv` using a relative path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r eval = FALSE}\n",
    "happy_data <- read_csv(\"data/happiness_report.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading `happiness_report.csv` using an absolute path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r eval = FALSE}\n",
    "happy_data <- read_csv(\"/home/dsci-100/worksheet_02/data/happiness_report.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So which one should you use? Generally speaking, to ensure your code can be run \n",
    "on a different computer, you should use relative paths. An added bonus is that \n",
    "it's also less typing! Generally, you should use relative paths because the file's \n",
    "absolute path (the names of \n",
    "folders between the computer's root `/` and the file) isn't usually the same \n",
    "across different computers. For example, suppose Fatima and Jayden are working on a \n",
    "project together on the `happiness_report.csv` data. Fatima's file is stored at \n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/Fatima/project/data/happiness_report.csv`, \n",
    "\n",
    "while Jayden's is stored at \n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/Jayden/project/data/happiness_report.csv`.\n",
    " \n",
    "Even though Fatima and Jayden stored their files in the same place on their\n",
    "computers (in their home folders), the absolute paths are different due to\n",
    "their different usernames.  If Jayden has code that loads the\n",
    "`happiness_report.csv` data using an absolute path, the code won't work on\n",
    "Fatima's computer.  But the relative path from inside the `project` folder\n",
    "(`data/happiness_report.csv`) is the same on both computers; any code that uses\n",
    "relative paths will work on both!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the additional resources section, we include a link to a short video on the\n",
    "difference between absolute and relative paths. You can also check out the\n",
    "`here` package, which provides methods for finding and constructing file paths\n",
    "in R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your file could be stored locally, as we discussed, or it could also be\n",
    "somewhere on the internet (remotely). A *Uniform Resource Locator (URL)* (web\n",
    "address) \\index{URL} indicates the location of a resource on the internet and\n",
    "helps us retrieve that resource. Next, we will discuss how to get either\n",
    "locally or remotely stored data into R. \n",

    "\n",
    "### `read_csv` to read in comma-separated files {#readcsv}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned about *where* data could be, we will learn about *how*\n",
    "to import data into R using various functions. Specifically, we will learn how \n",
    "to *read* tabular data from a plain text file (a document containing only text)\n",
    "*into* R and *write* tabular data to a file *out of* R. The function we use to do this\n",
    "depends on the file's format. For example, in the last chapter, we learned about using\n",
    "the `tidyverse` `read_csv` function when reading .csv (**c**omma-**s**eparated **v**alues)\n",
    "files. \\index{csv} In that case, the separator or *delimiter* \\index{reading!delimiter} that divided our columns was a\n",
    "comma (`,`). We only learned the case where the data matched the expected defaults \n",
    "of the `read_csv` function \\index{read function!read\\_csv}\n",
    "(column names are present, and commas are used as the delimiter between columns). \n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to read \n",
    "files that do not satisfy the default expectations of `read_csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into the cases where the data aren't in the expected default format \n",
    "for `tidyverse` and `read_csv`, let's revisit the more straightforward\n",
    "case where the defaults hold, and the only argument we need to give to the function\n",
    "is the path to the file, `data/can_lang.csv`. The `can_lang` data set contains \n",
    "language data from the 2016 Canadian census. \\index{Canadian languages!canlang data} \n",
    "We put `data/` before the file's\n",
    "name when we are loading the data set because this data set is located in a\n",
    "sub-folder, named `data`, relative to where we are running our R code.\n",

    "## Reading data from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very common form of data storage is the relational database. Databases\n",
    "\\index{database} are great when you have large data sets or multiple users\n",
    "working on a project. There are many relational database management systems,\n",
    "such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,\n",
    " and many more. These\n",
    "different relational database management systems each have their own advantages\n",
    "and limitations. Almost all employ SQL (*structured query language*) to obtain\n",
    "data from the database. But you don't need to know SQL to analyze data from\n",
    "a database; several packages have been written that allow you to connect to\n",
    "relational databases and use the R programming language \n",
    "to obtain data. In this book, we will give examples of how to do this\n",
    "using R with SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading data from a SQLite database\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite \\index{database!SQLite} is probably the simplest relational database system\n",
    "that one can use in combination with R. SQLite databases are self-contained and\n",
    "usually stored and accessed locally on one computer. Data is usually stored in\n",
    "a file with a `.db` extension. Similar to Excel files, these are not plain text\n",
    "files and cannot be read in a plain text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do to read data into R from a database is to\n",
    "connect to the database. We do that using the `dbConnect` function from the\n",
    "`DBI` (database interface) package. \\index{database!connect} This does not read\n",
    "in the data, but simply tells R where the database is and opens up a\n",
    "communication channel that R can use to send SQL commands to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "library(DBI)\n",
    "\n",
    "conn_lang_data <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"data/can_lang.db\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Often relational databases have many tables; thus, in order to retrieve\n",
    "data from a database, you need to know the name of the table \n",
    "in which the data is stored. You can get the names of\n",
    "all the tables in the database using the `dbListTables` \\index{database!tables}\n",
    "function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "tables <- dbListTables(conn_lang_data)\n",
    "tables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dbListTables` function returned only one name, which tells us\n",
    "that there is only one table in this database. To reference a table in the\n",
    "database (so that we can perform operations like selecting columns and filtering rows), we \n",
    "use the `tbl` function \\index{database!tbl} from the `dbplyr` package. The object returned\n",
    "by the `tbl` function \\index{dbplyr|see{database}}\\index{database!dbplyr} allows us to work with data\n",
    "stored in databases as if they were just regular data frames; but secretly, behind\n",
    "the scenes, `dbplyr` is turning your function calls (e.g., `select` and `filter`)\n",

    "It's a *reference*; the data is still stored only in the SQLite database. The\n",
    "`dbplyr` package works this way because databases are often more efficient at selecting, filtering\n",
    "and joining large data sets than R. And typically the database will not even\n",
    "be stored on your computer, but rather a more powerful machine somewhere on the\n",
    "web. So R is lazy and waits to bring this data into memory until you explicitly\n",
    "tell it to using the `collect` \\index{database!collect} function. \n",

    "response for us. So `dbplyr` does all the hard work of translating from R to SQL and back for us; \n",
    "we can just stick with R! \n",
    "\n",
    "With our `lang_db` table reference for the 2016 Canadian Census data in hand, we \n",
    "can mostly continue onward as if it were a regular data frame. For example, \n",
    "we can use the `filter` function\n",
    "to obtain only certain rows. Below we filter the data to include only Aboriginal languages.\n",

    "and a database type `sqlite 3.36.0` is listed.\n",
    "In order to actually retrieve this data in R as a data frame,\n",
    "we use the `collect` function. \\index{filter}\n",
    "Below you will see that after running `collect`, R knows that the retrieved\n",
    "data has 67 rows, and there is no database listed any more.\n",
    "\n",

    "aboriginal_lang_data <- collect(aboriginal_lang_db)\n",
    "aboriginal_lang_data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from knowing the number of rows, the data looks pretty similar in both\n",
    "outputs shown above. And `dbplyr` provides many more functions (not just `filter`) \n",
    "that you can use to directly feed the database reference (`lang_db`) into \n",
    "downstream analysis functions (e.g., `ggplot2` for data visualization). \n",
    "But `dbplyr` does not provide *every* function that we need for analysis;\n",
    "we do eventually need to call `collect`.\n",
    "For example, look what happens when we try to use `nrow` to count rows\n",
    "in a data frame: \\index{nrow}\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "nrow(aboriginal_lang_db)\n",

    "\\newpage\n",

    "Additionally, some operations will not work to extract columns or single values\n",
    "from the reference given by the `tbl` function. Thus, once you have finished\n",
    "your data wrangling of the `tbl` database reference object, it is advisable to\n",
    "bring it into R as a data frame using `collect`.\n",
    "But be very careful using `collect`: databases are often *very* big,\n",
    "and reading an entire table into R might take a long time to run or even possibly\n",
    "crash your machine. So make sure you use `filter` and `select` on the database table\n",

    "### Reading data from a PostgreSQL database \n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL (also called Postgres) \\index{database!PostgreSQL} is a very popular\n",

    "Unlike SQLite,\n",
    "PostgreSQL uses a client–server database engine, as it was designed to be used\n",

    "\n",
    "- `dbname`: the name of the database (a single PostgreSQL instance can host more than one database)\n",

    "\n",
    "- They enable storing large data sets across multiple computers with backups.\n",
    "- They provide mechanisms for ensuring data integrity and validating input.\n",
    "- They provide security and data access control.\n",

    "  For example, there are billions of Google searches conducted daily in 2021 [@googlesearches]. \n",

    "to a file to share it with others or use it for another step in the analysis.\n",
    "The most straightforward way to do this is to use the `write_csv` function\n",
    "\\index{write function!write\\_csv} from the `tidyverse` package.  The default\n",

    "> **Note:** This section is not required reading for the remainder of the textbook. It\n",
    "> is included for those readers interested in learning a little bit more about\n",
    "> how to obtain different types of data from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data doesn't just magically appear on your computer; you need to get it from\n",
    "somewhere. Earlier in the chapter we showed you how to access data stored in a\n",
    "plain text, spreadsheet-like format (e.g., comma- or tab-separated) from a web\n",
    "URL using one of the `read_*` functions from the `tidyverse`. But as time goes\n",
    "on, it is increasingly uncommon to find data (especially large amounts of data)\n",
    "in this format available for download from a URL. Instead, websites now often\n",
    "offer something known as an **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterface\n",
    "(API), \\index{application programming interface|see{API}}\\index{API} which\n",
    "provides a programmatic way to ask for subsets of a data set. This allows the\n",
    "website owner to control *who* has access to the data, *what portion* of the\n",
    "data they have access to, and *how much* data they can access.  Typically, the\n",
    "website owner will give you a *token* (a secret string of characters somewhat\n",
    "like a password) that you have to provide when accessing the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thought: websites themselves *are* data! When you type a\n",
    "URL into your browser window, your browser asks the *web server* (another\n",
    "computer on the internet whose job it is to respond to requests for the\n",
    "website) to give it the website's data, and then your browser translates that\n",
    "data into something you can see. If the website shows you some information that\n",
    "you're interested in, you could *create* a data set for yourself by copying and\n",
    "pasting that information into a file. This process of taking information\n",
    "directly from what a website displays is called \\index{web scraping} \n",
    "*web scraping* (or sometimes *screen scraping*). Now, of course, copying and pasting\n",
    "information manually is a painstaking and error-prone process, especially when\n",
    "there is a lot of information to gather. So instead of asking your browser to\n",
    "translate the information that the web server provides into something you can\n",
    "see, you can collect that data programmatically&mdash;in the form of\n",
    "**h**yper**t**ext **m**arkup **l**anguage \n",
    "(HTML) \\index{hypertext markup language|see{HTML}}\\index{cascading style sheet|see{CSS}}\\index{CSS}\\index{HTML} \n",
    "and **c**ascading **s**tyle **s**heet (CSS) code&mdash;and process it \n",
    "to extract useful information. HTML provides the\n",
    "basic structure of a site and tells the webpage how to display the content\n",
    "(e.g., titles, paragraphs, bullet lists etc.), whereas CSS helps style the\n",
    "content and tells the webpage how the HTML elements should \n",
    "be presented (e.g., colors, layouts, fonts etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "This subsection will show you the basics of both web scraping\n",
    "with the [`rvest` R package](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) [@rvest]\n",

    "### Using an API\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than posting a data file at a URL for you to download, many websites these days\n",
    "provide an API \\index{API} that must be accessed through a programming language like R. The benefit of this\n",
    "is that data owners have much more control over the data they provide to users. However, unlike\n",
    "web scraping, there is no consistent way to access an API across websites. Every website typically\n",
    "has its own API designed especially for its own use case. Therefore we will just provide one example\n",
    "of accessing data through an API in this book, with the hope that it gives you enough of a basic\n",
    "idea that you can learn how to use another API if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in this book we will show you the basics of how to use\n",
    "the `rtweet` package in R\\index{API!rtweet}\\index{rtweet}\\index{Twitter} to access\n",
    "data from the Twitter API. One nice feature of this particular \n",
    "API is that you don't need  a special *token* \\index{API!token} to access it; you simply need to \n",
    "make an account with them. Your access to the data will then be authenticated and controlled through\n",
    "your account username and password. If you have a Twitter \n",
    "account already (or are willing to make one), you can follow\n",
    "along with the examples that we show here. To get started, load the `rtweet` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "library(rtweet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides an extensive set of functions to search \n",
    "Twitter for tweets, users, their followers, and more. \n",
    "Let's construct a small data set of the last 400 tweets and \n",
    "retweets from the \\@tidyverse account. A few of the most recent tweets\n",
    "are shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:01-tidyverse-twitter).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r 01-tidyverse-twitter, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = \"The tidyverse account Twitter feed.\", fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "knitr::include_graphics(\"img/tidyverse_twitter.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop! Think about your API usage carefully!**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access an API, you are initiating a transfer of data from a web server\n",
    "to your computer. Web servers are expensive to run and do not have infinite resources.\n",
    "If you try to ask for *too much data* at once, you can use up a huge amount of the server's bandwidth. \n",
    "If you try to ask for data *too frequently*&mdash;e.g., if you \n",
    "make many requests to the server in quick succession&mdash;you can also bog the server down and make\n",
    "it unable to talk to anyone else. Most servers have mechanisms to revoke your access if you are not\n",
    "careful, but you should try to prevent issues from happening in the first place by being extra careful\n",
    "with how you write and run your code. You should also keep in mind that when a website owner\n",
    "grants you API access, they also usually specify a limit (or *quota*) of how much data you can ask for.\n",
    "Be careful not to overrun your quota! In this example, we should take a look at\n",
    " [the Twitter website](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) to see what limits\n",
    "we should abide by when using the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `rtweet`**\n",
    "\n",
    "After checking the Twitter website, it seems like asking for 400 tweets one time is acceptable.\n",
    "So we can use the `get_timelines` function to ask for the last 400 tweets from the \\@tidyverse account.\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "tidyverse_tweets <- get_timelines('tidyverse', n=400)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "This is the `rtweet` package asking you to provide your own Twitter account's login information.\n",
    "When `rtweet` talks to the Twitter API, it uses your account information to authenticate requests;\n",
    "Twitter then can keep track of how much data you're asking for, and how frequently you're asking.\n",
    "If you want to follow along with this example using your own Twitter account, you should read\n",
    "over the list of permissions you are granting `rtweet` *very carefully* and make sure you are comfortable\n",
    "with it. Note that `rtweet` can be used to manage most aspects of your account (make posts, follow others, etc.),\n",
    "which is why `rtweet` asks for such extensive permissions.\n",
    "If you decide to allow `rtweet` to talk to the Twitter API using your account information, then \n",
    "input your username and password and hit \"Sign In.\" Twitter will probably send you an email to say\n",
    "that there was an unusual login attempt on your account, and in that case you will have to take\n",
    "the one-time code they send you and provide that to the `rtweet` login page too. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Every API has its own way to authenticate users when they try to access data. Many APIs require you to\n",
    "> sign up to receive a *token*, which is a secret password that you input into the R package (like `rtweet`) \n",
    "> that you are using to access the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the authentication setup out of the way, let's run the `get_timelines` function again to actually access\n",
    "the API and take a look at what was returned:\n",
