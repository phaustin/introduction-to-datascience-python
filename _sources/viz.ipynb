    "## Overview \n",
    "This chapter will introduce concepts and tools relating to data visualization\n",
    "beyond what we have seen and practiced so far.  We will focus on guiding\n",
    "principles for effective data visualization and explaining visualizations\n",
    "independent of any particular tool or programming language.  In the process, we\n",
    "will cover some specifics of creating visualizations (scatter plots, bar\n",
    "plots, line plots, and histograms) for data using R. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe when to use the following kinds of visualizations to answer specific questions using a data set:\n",
    "    - scatter plots\n",
    "    - line plots\n",
    "    - bar plots \n",
    "    - histogram plots\n",
    "- Given a data set and a question, select from the above plot types and use R to create a visualization that best answers the question.\n",
    "- Given a visualization and a question, evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization and suggest improvements to better answer the question.\n",
    "- Referring to the visualization, communicate the conclusions in non-technical terms.\n",
    "- Identify rules of thumb for creating effective visualizations. \n",
    "- Define the three key aspects of ggplot objects:\n",
    "    - aesthetic mappings\n",
    "    - geometric objects\n",
    "    - scales\n",
    "- Use the `ggplot2` package in R to create and refine the above visualizations using:\n",
    "    - geometric objects: `geom_point`, `geom_line`, `geom_histogram`, `geom_bar`, `geom_vline`, `geom_hline`\n",
    "    - scales: `xlim`, `ylim`\n",
    "    - aesthetic mappings: `x`, `y`, `fill`, `color`, `shape`\n",
    "    - labeling: `xlab`, `ylab`, `labs`\n",
    "    - font control and legend positioning: `theme`\n",
    "    - subplots: `facet_grid`\n",
    "- Describe the difference in raster and vector output formats.\n",

    "Just being able to make a visualization in R with `ggplot2` (or any other tool\n",

    "others. Once you have selected a broad type of visualization to use, you will\n",

    "\n",
    "**Convey the message**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the visualization answers the question you have asked most simply and plainly as possible.\n",
    "- Use legends and labels so that your visualization is understandable without reading the surrounding text.\n",

    "**Minimize noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use colors sparingly. Too many different colors can be distracting, create false patterns, and detract from the message. \n",
    "- Be wary of overplotting. Overplotting is when marks that represent the data\n",
    "  overlap, and is problematic as it prevents you from seeing how many data\n",

    "  plot has too many dots or lines and starts to look like a mess, you need to do\n",

    "#### Choosing a binwidth for histograms {-}\n",
    "\n",

    "But what number of bins, or bin width, is the right one to use? \n",

    "the one that *helps you answer the question* you asked. \n",
    "Choosing the correct setting for your problem \n",
    "is something that commonly takes iteration.\n",
    "We recommend setting the *bin width* (not the *number of bins*) because\n",
    "it often more directly corresponds to values in your problem of interest. For example,\n",
    "if you are looking at a histogram of human heights,\n",
    "a bin width of 1 inch would likely be reasonable, while the number of bins to use is \n",
    "not immediately clear.\n",

    "  The site also provides a very nice cheat sheet that summarizes many of the data\n",

    "  `ggplot2` than what is included in this chapter.\n",
    "- The [`theme` function documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)\n",
