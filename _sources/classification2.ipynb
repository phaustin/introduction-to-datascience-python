    "## Overview \n",
    "This chapter continues the introduction to predictive modeling through\n",
    "classification. While the previous chapter covered training and data\n",
    "preprocessing, this chapter focuses on how to evaluate the accuracy of\n",
    "a classifier, as well as how to improve the classifier (where possible)\n",
    "to maximize its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives \n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what training, validation, and test data sets are and how they are used in classification.\n",
    "- Split data into training, validation, and test data sets.\n",
    "- Describe what a random seed is and its importance in reproducible data analysis.\n",
    "- Set the random seed in R using the `set.seed` function.\n",
    "- Evaluate classification accuracy in R using a validation data set and appropriate metrics.\n",
    "- Execute cross-validation in R to choose the number of neighbors in a $K$-nearest neighbors classifier.\n",
    "- Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the $K$-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.\n",

    "and think about how our classifier will be used in practice. A biopsy will be\n",
    "performed on a *new* patient's tumor, the resulting image will be analyzed,\n",
    "and the classifier will be asked to decide whether the tumor is benign or\n",
    "malignant. The key word here is *new*: our classifier is \"good\" if it provides\n",

    "Then, to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, we first set aside the true labels from the **test set**,\n",

    "## Randomness and seeds {#randomseeds}\n",
    "Beginning in this chapter, our data analyses will often involve the use\n",
    "of *randomness*. \\index{random} We use randomness any time we need to make a decision in our\n",
    "analysis that needs to be fair, unbiased, and not influenced by human input.\n",
    "For example, in this chapter, we need to split\n",
    "a data set into a training set and test set to evaluate our classifier. We \n",
    "certainly do not want to choose how to split\n",
    "the data ourselves by hand, as we want to avoid accidentally influencing the result\n",
    "of the evaluation. So instead, we let R *randomly* split the data.\n",
    "In future chapters we will use randomness\n",
    "in many other ways, e.g., to help us select a small subset of data from a larger data set, \n",
    "to pick groupings of data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the use of randomness runs counter to one of the main \n",
    "tenets of good data analysis practice: \\index{reproducible} *reproducibility*. Recall that a reproducible\n",
    "analysis produces the same result each time it is run; if we include randomness\n",
    "in the analysis, would we not get a different result each time?\n",
    "The trick is that in R&mdash;and other programming languages&mdash;randomness \n",
    "is not actually random! Instead, R uses a *random number generator* that\n",
    "produces a sequence of numbers that\n",
    "are completely determined by a \\index{seed} \\index{random seed|see{seed}}\n",
    " *seed value*. Once you set the seed value \n",
    "using the \\index{seed!set.seed} `set.seed` function, everything after that point may *look* random,\n",
    "but is actually totally reproducible. As long as you pick the same seed\n",
    "value, you get the same result!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example to investigate how seeds work in R. Say we want \n",
    "to randomly pick 10 numbers from 0 to 9 in R using the `sample` \\index{sample!function} function,\n",
    "but we want it to be reproducible. Before using the sample function,\n",
    "we call `set.seed`, and pass it any integer as an argument. \n",
    "Here, we pass in the number `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "set.seed(1)\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that `random_numbers` is a list of 10 numbers\n",
    "from 0 to 9 that, from all appearances, looks random. If \n",
    "we run the `sample` function again, we will \n",
    "get a fresh batch of 10 numbers that also look random.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to force R to produce the same sequences of random numbers,\n",
    "we can simply call the `set.seed` function again with the same argument\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "set.seed(1)\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we choose \n",
    "a different value for the seed&mdash;say, 4235&mdash;we\n",
    "obtain a different sequence of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "set.seed(4235)\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "random_numbers <- sample(0:9, 10, replace=TRUE)\n",
    "random_numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, even though the sequences of numbers that R is generating *look*\n",
    "random, they are totally determined when we set a seed value! \n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean for data analysis? Well, `sample` is certainly\n",
    "not the only function that uses randomness in R. Many of the functions \n",
    "that we use in `tidymodels`, `tidyverse`, and beyond use randomness&mdash;many of them\n",
    "without even telling you about it. So at the beginning of every data analysis you\n",
    "do, right after loading packages, you should call the `set.seed` function and\n",
    "pass it an integer that you pick.\n",
    "Also note that when R starts up, it creates its own seed to use. So if you do not\n",
    "explicitly call the `set.seed` function in your code, your results will \n",
    "likely not be reproducible.\n",
    "And finally, be careful to set the seed *only once* at the beginning of a data\n",
    "analysis. Each time you set the seed, you are inserting your own human input,\n",
    "thereby influencing the analysis. If you use `set.seed` many times\n",
    "throughout your analysis, the randomness that R uses will not look \n",
    "as random as it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: if you want your analysis to be reproducible, i.e., produce *the same result* each time you\n",
    "run it, make sure to use `set.seed` exactly once at the beginning of the analysis.\n",
    "Different argument values in `set.seed` lead to different patterns of randomness, but as long as \n",
    "you pick the same argument value your result will be the same. \n",
    "In the remainder of the textbook, we will set the seed once at the beginning of each chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating accuracy with `tidymodels`\n",

    "### Create the train / test split\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have decided on a predictive question to answer and done some\n",
    "preliminary exploration, the very next thing to do is to split the data into\n",
    "the training and test sets. Typically, the training set is between 50% and 95% of\n",
    "the data, while the test set is the remaining 5% to 50%; the intuition is that\n",
    "you want to trade off between training an accurate model (by using a larger\n",
    "training data set) and getting an accurate evaluation of its performance (by\n",
    "using a larger test data set). Here, we will use 75% of the data for training,\n",
    "and 25% for testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `initial_split` function \\index{tidymodels!initial\\_split} from `tidymodels` handles the procedure of splitting\n",
    "the data for us. It also applies two very important steps when splitting to ensure\n",
    "that the accuracy estimates from the test data are reasonable. First, it\n",
    "**shuffles** the \\index{shuffling} data before splitting, which ensures that any ordering present\n",
    "in the data does not influence the data that ends up in the training and testing sets.\n",
    "Second, it **stratifies** the \\index{stratification} data by the class label, to ensure that roughly\n",
    "the same proportion of each class ends up in both the training and testing sets. For example,\n",
    "in our data set, roughly 63% of the\n",
    "observations are from the benign class (`B`), and 37% are from the malignant class (`M`),\n",
    "so `initial_split` ensures that roughly 63% of the training data are benign, \n",
    "37% of the training data are malignant,\n",
    "and the same proportions exist in the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the `initial_split` function to create the training and testing sets.\n",
    "We will specify that `prop = 0.75` so that 75% of our original data set ends up\n",
    "in the training set. We will also set the `strata` argument to the categorical label variable\n",
    "(here, `Class`) to ensure that the training and testing subsets contain the\n",

    "The `training` and `testing` functions then extract the training and testing\n",

    "Or do we need something higher?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, what a *good* value for accuracy \\index{accuracy!assessment} is depends on the application.\n",
    " For instance, suppose you are predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant\n",
    " for a type of tumor that is benign 99% of the time. It is very easy to obtain \n",
    " a 99% accuracy just by guessing benign for every observation. In this case, \n",
    " 99% accuracy is probably not good enough.  And beyond just accuracy,\n",
    "sometimes the *kind* of mistake the classifier makes is important as well. In\n",
    "the previous example, it might be very bad for the classifier to predict\n",
    "\"benign\" when the true class is \"malignant\", as this might result in a patient\n",
    "not receiving appropriate medical attention. On the other hand, it might be\n",
    "less bad for the classifier to guess \"malignant\" when the true class is\n",
    "\"benign\", as the patient will then likely see a doctor who can provide an\n",
    "expert diagnosis. This is why it is important not only to look at accuracy, but\n",
    "also the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is always an easy baseline that you can compare to for any\n",
    "classification problem: the *majority classifier*. The majority classifier \\index{classification!majority}\n",
    "*always* guesses the majority class label from the training data, regardless of\n",
    "the predictor variables' values.  It helps to give you a sense of\n",
    "scale when considering accuracies. If the majority classifier obtains a 90%\n",
    "accuracy on a problem, then you might hope for your $K$-nearest neighbors\n",
    "classifier to do better than that. If your classifier provides a significant\n",
    "improvement upon the majority classifier, this means that at least your method\n",
    "is extracting some useful information from your predictor variables.  Be\n",
    "careful though: improving on the majority classifier does not *necessarily*\n",
    "mean the classifier is working well enough for your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in the breast cancer data, recall the proportions of benign and malignant\n",
    "observations in the training data are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the benign class represents the majority of the training data,\n",
    "the majority classifier would *always* predict that a new observation\n",
    "is benign. The estimated accuracy of the majority classifier is usually\n",
    "fairly close to the majority class proportion in the training data.\n",
    "In this case, we would suspect that the majority classifier will have \n",
    "an accuracy of around `r round(cancer_propn_1[1,1], 0)`%.\n",
    "The $K$-nearest neighbors classifier we built does quite a bit better than this, \n",
    "with an accuracy of `r round(100*cancer_acc_1$.estimate, 0)`%. \n",
    "This means that from the perspective of accuracy,\n",
    "the $K$-nearest neighbors classifier improved quite a bit on the basic\n",
    "majority classifier. Hooray! But we still need to be cautious; in \n",
    "this application, it is likely very important not to misdiagnose any malignant tumors to avoid missing\n",
    "patients who actually need medical care. The confusion matrix above shows\n",
    "that the classifier does, indeed, misdiagnose a significant number of malignant tumors as benign (`r confu21`\n",
    "out of `r confu11+confu21` malignant tumors, or `r round(100*(confu21)/(confu11+confu21))`%!).\n",

    "our critical analysis suggests that this classifier may not have appropriate performance\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tuning the classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of predictive models in statistics and machine learning have\n",
    "*parameters*. A *parameter* \\index{parameter}\\index{tuning parameter|see{parameter}}\n",
    "is a number you have to pick in advance that determines\n",
    "some aspect of how the model behaves. For example, in the $K$-nearest neighbors\n",
    "classification algorithm, $K$ is a parameter that we have to pick\n",
    "that determines how many neighbors participate in the class vote. \n",
    "By picking different values of $K$, we create different classifiers \n",
    "that make different predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, how do we pick the *best* value of $K$, i.e., *tune* the model? \n",
    "And is it possible to make this selection in a principled way?  Ideally, \n",
    "we want somehow to maximize the performance of our classifier on data *it\n",
    "hasn't seen yet*. But we cannot use our test data set in the process of building\n",
    "our model. So we will play the same trick we did before when evaluating\n",
    "our classifier: we'll split our *training data itself* into two subsets,\n",
    "use one to train the model, and then use the other to evaluate it.\n",
    "In this section, we will cover the details of this procedure, as well as \n",
    "how to use it to help you pick a good parameter value for your classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And remember:** don't touch the test set during the tuning process. Tuning is a part of model training!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in choosing the parameter $K$ is to be able to evaluate the \n",
    "classifier using only the training data. If this is possible, then we can compare\n",
    "the classifier's performance for different values of $K$&mdash;and pick the best&mdash;using \n",
    "only the training data. As suggested at the beginning of this section, we will\n",
    "accomplish this by splitting the training data, training on one subset, and evaluating\n",
    "on the other. The subset of training data used for evaluation is often called the **validation set**. \\index{validation set}\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, one key difference from the train/test split\n",
    "that we performed earlier. In particular, we were forced to make only a *single split*\n",
    "of the data. This is because at the end of the day, we have to produce a single classifier.\n",
    "If we had multiple different splits of the data into training and testing data,\n",
    "we would produce multiple different classifiers.\n",
    "But while we are tuning the classifier, we are free to create multiple classifiers\n",
    "based on multiple splits of the training data, evaluate them, and then choose a parameter\n",
    "value based on __*all*__ of the different results. If we just split our overall training\n",
    "data *once*, our best parameter choice will depend strongly on whatever data\n",
    "was lucky enough to end up in the validation set. Perhaps using multiple\n",
    "different train/validation splits, we'll get a better estimate of accuracy,\n",
    "which will lead to a better choice of the number of neighbors $K$ for the\n",
    "overall set of training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate this idea in R! In particular, we will generate five different train/validation\n",

    "### Finding a good subset of predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, if it is not ideal to use all of our variables as predictors without consideration, how \n",
    "do we choose which variables we *should* use?  A simple method is to rely on your scientific understanding\n",
    "of the data to tell you which variables are not likely to be useful predictors. For example, in the cancer\n",
    "data that we have been studying, the `ID` variable is just a unique identifier for the observation.\n",
    "As it is not related to any measured property of the cells, the `ID` variable should therefore not be used\n",
    "as a predictor. That is, of course, a very clear-cut case. But the decision for the remaining variables \n",
    "is less obvious, as all seem like reasonable candidates. It \n",
    "is not clear which subset of them will create the best classifier. One could use visualizations and\n",
    "other exploratory analyses to try to help understand which variables are potentially relevant, but\n",
    "this process is both time-consuming and error-prone when there are many variables to consider.\n",
    "Therefore we need a more systematic and programmatic way of choosing variables. \n",
    "This is a very difficult problem to solve in\n",
    "general, and there are a number of methods that have been developed that apply\n",
    "in particular cases of interest. Here we will discuss two basic\n",
    "selection methods as an introduction to the topic. See the additional resources at the end of\n",
    "this chapter to find out where you can learn more about variable selection, including more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first idea you might think of for a systematic way to select predictors\n",
    "is to try all possible subsets of predictors and then pick the set that results in the \"best\" classifier.\n",
    "This procedure is indeed a well-known variable selection method referred to \n",
    "as *best subset selection* [@bealesubset; @hockingsubset]. \\index{variable selection!best subset}\\index{predictor selection|see{variable selection}}\n",
    "In particular, you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a separate model for every possible subset of predictors,\n",
    "2. tune each one using cross-validation, and\n",
    "3. pick the subset of predictors that gives you the highest cross-validation accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Best subset selection is applicable to any classification method ($K$-NN or otherwise).\n",
    "However, it becomes very slow when you have even a moderate\n",
    "number of predictors to choose from (say, around 10). This is because the number of possible predictor subsets\n",
    "grows very quickly with the number of predictors, and you have to train the model (itself\n",
    "a slow process!) for each one. For example, if we have $2$ predictors&mdash;let's call\n",
    "them A and B&mdash;then we have 3 variable sets to try: A alone, B alone, and finally A\n",
    "and B together. If we have $3$ predictors&mdash;A, B, and C&mdash;then we have 7\n",
    "to try: A, B, C, AB, BC, AC, and ABC. In general, the number of models\n",
    "we have to train for $m$ predictors is $2^m-1$; in other words, when we \n",
    "get to $10$ predictors we have over *one thousand* models to train, and \n",
    "at $20$ predictors we have over *one million* models to train! \n",
    "So although it is a simple method, best subset selection is usually too computationally \n",
    "expensive to use in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to iteratively build up a model by adding one predictor variable \n",
    "at a time. This method&mdash;known as *forward selection* [@forwardefroymson; @forwarddraper]&mdash;is also widely \\index{variable selection!forward}\n",
    "applicable and fairly straightforward. It involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a model having no predictors.\n",
    "2. Run the following 3 steps until you run out of predictors:\n",
    "    1. For each unused predictor, add it to the model to form a *candidate model*.\n",
    "    2. Tune all of the candidate models.\n",
    "    3. Update the model to be the candidate model with the highest cross-validation accuracy.\n",
    "3. Select the model that provides the best trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have $m$ total predictors to work with. In the first iteration, you have to make\n",
    "$m$ candidate models, each with 1 predictor. Then in the second iteration, you have\n",
    "to make $m-1$ candidate models, each with 2 predictors (the one you chose before and a new one).\n",
    "This pattern continues for as many iterations as you want. If you run the method\n",
    "all the way until you run out of predictors to choose, you will end up training\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{2}m(m+1)$ separate models. This is a *big* improvement from the $2^m-1$\n",
    "models that best subset selection requires you to train! For example, while best subset selection requires\n",
    "training over 1000 candidate models with $m=10$ predictors, forward selection requires training only 55 candidate models.\n",
    " Therefore we will continue the rest of this section using forward selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** One word of caution before we move on. Every additional model that you train \n",
    "> increases the likelihood that you will get unlucky and stumble \n",
    "> on a model that has a high cross-validation accuracy estimate, but a low true\n",
    "> accuracy on the test data and other future observations.\n",
    "> Since forward selection involves training a lot of models, you run a fairly\n",
    "> high risk of this happening. To keep this risk low, only use forward selection\n",
    "> when you have a large amount of data and a relatively small total number of \n",
    "> predictors. More advanced methods do not suffer from this\n",
    "> problem as much; see the additional resources at the end of this chapter for\n",
    "> where to learn more about advanced predictor selection methods. \n",

    "The `collapse` argument tells `paste` what to put between the items in the list;\n",
    "to make a formula, we need to put a `+` symbol between each variable.\n",
