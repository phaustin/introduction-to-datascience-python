    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will introduce the concept of using version control systems \n",
    "to track changes to a project over its lifespan, to share \n",
    "and edit code in a collaborative team, \n",
    "and to distribute the finished project to its intended audience.\n",
    "This chapter will also introduce how to use \n",
    "the two most common version control tools: Git \\index{git} for local version control, \n",
    "and GitHub \\index{GitHub} for remote version control. \n",
    "We will focus on the most common version control operations \n",
    "used day-to-day in a standard data science project. \n",
    "There are many user interfaces for Git; in this chapter \n",
    "we will cover the Jupyter Git interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what version control is and why data analysis projects can benefit from it.\n",
    "- Create a remote version control repository on GitHub.\n",
    "- Use Jupyter's Git version control tools for project versioning and collaboration: \n",
    "  - Clone a remote version control repository to create a local repository.\n",
    "  - Commit changes to a local version control repository.\n",
    "  - Push local changes to a remote version control repository.\n",
    "  - Pull changes from a remote version control repository to a local version control repository.\n",
    "  - Resolve merge conflicts.\n",
    "- Give collaborators access to a remote GitHub repository.\n",
    "- Communicate with collaborators using GitHub issues.\n",
    "- Use best practices when collaborating on a project with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is version control, and why should I use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis projects often require iteration \n",
    "and revision to move from an initial idea to a finished product\n",
    "ready for the intended audience. \n",
    "Without deliberate and conscious effort towards tracking changes \n",
    "made to the analysis, projects tend to become messy. \n",
    "This mess can have serious, negative repercussions on an analysis project, \n",
    "including interesting results files that your code cannot reproduce,\n",
    "temporary files with snippets of ideas that are forgotten or \n",
    "not easy to find, mind-boggling file names that make it unclear which is\n",
    "the current working version of the file (e.g., `document_final_draft_final.txt`, \n",
    "`to_hand_in_final_v2.txt`, etc.), and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the iterative nature of data analysis projects \n",
    "means that most of the time, the final version of the analysis that is\n",
    "shared with the audience is only a fraction of what was explored during \n",
    "the development of that analysis. \n",
    "Changes in data visualizations and modeling approaches, \n",
    "as well as some negative results, are often not observable from \n",
    "reviewing only the final, polished analysis.\n",
    "The lack of observability of these parts of the analysis development\n",
    "can lead to others repeating things that did not work well, \n",
    "instead of seeing what did not work well, \n",
    "and using that as a springboard to new, more fruitful approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, data analyses are typically completed by a team of people \n",
    "rather than a single person. \n",
    "This means that files need to be shared across multiple computers, \n",
    "and multiple people often end up editing the project simultaneously. \n",
    "In such a situation, determining who has the latest version of the \n",
    "project&mdash;and how to resolve conflicting edits&mdash;can be a real challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Version control* \\index{version control} helps solve these challenges. Version control is the process\n",
    "of keeping a record of changes to documents, including when the changes were\n",
    "made and who made them, throughout the history of their development.  It also\n",
    "provides the means both to view earlier versions of the project and to revert\n",
    "changes.  Version control is most commonly used in software development, but\n",
    "can be used for any electronic files for any type of project, including data\n",
    "analyses.  Being able to record and view the history of a data analysis project\n",
    "is important for understanding how and why decisions to use one method or\n",
    "another were made, among other things.  Version control also facilitates\n",
    "collaboration via tools to share edits with others and resolve conflicting\n",
    "edits.  But even if you're working on a project alone, you should still use\n",
    "version control.  It helps you keep track of what you've done, when you did it,\n",
    "and what you're planning to do next!"

    "## Version control repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when we put a data analysis project under version control, \n",
    "we create two copies of the repository \\index{repository} (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes)). \n",
    "One copy we use as our primary workspace where we create, edit, and delete files.\n",

    "repository most commonly exists on our computer or laptop, but can also exist within\n",
    "a workspace on a server (e.g., JupyterHub).\n",
    "The other copy is typically stored in a repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub), where\n",
    "we can easily share it with our collaborators. \n",
    "This copy is commonly referred to as \\index{repository!remote} the **remote repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc1-no-changes, fig.cap = 'Schematic of local and remote version control repositories.', fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "image_read(\"img/vc1-no-changes.png\") |>\n",
    "  image_crop(\"3632x2000\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both copies of the repository have a **working directory** \\index{working directory} \n",
    "where you can create, store, edit, and delete \n",
    "files (e.g., `analysis.ipynb` in Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes)).\n",
    "Both copies of the repository also maintain a full project history \n",
    "(Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes)).  This history is a record of all versions of the\n",
    "project files that have been created.  The repository history is not\n",
    "automatically generated; Git must be explicitly told when to record\n",
    "a version of the project.  These records are \\index{git!commit} called **commits**. They \n",
    "are a snapshot of the file contents as well\n",
    "metadata about the repository at that time the record was created (who made the\n",
    "commit, when it was made, etc.). In the local and remote repositories shown in\n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes), there are two commits represented as gray\n",
    "circles.  Each commit can be identified by a \n",
    "human-readable **message**, which you write when you make a commit, and a\n",
    "**commit hash** that Git automatically adds for you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the message is to contain a brief, rich description \n",
    "of what work was done since the last commit.\n",
    "Messages act as a very useful narrative \n",
    "of the changes to a project over its lifespan. \n",
    "If you ever want to view or revert to an earlier version of the project,\n",
    "the message can help you identify which commit to view or revert to.\n",
    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes), you can see two such messages, \n",
    "one for each commit: `Created README.md` and `Added analysis draft`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash \\index{hash} is a string of characters consisting of about 40 letters and numbers.\n",
    "The purpose of the hash is to serve as a unique identifier for the commit,\n",
    "and is used by Git to index project history. Although hashes are quite long&mdash;imagine \n",
    "having to type out 40 precise characters to view an old project version!&mdash;Git is able\n",
    "to work with shorter versions of hashes. In Figure \\@ref(fig:vc1-no-changes), you can see\n",
    "two of these shortened hashes, one for each commit: `Daa29d6` and `884c7ce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version control workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work in a local version-controlled repository, there are generally three additional\n",
    "steps you must take as part of your regular workflow. In addition to \n",
    "just working on files&mdash;creating,\n",
    "editing, and deleting files as you normally would&mdash;you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tell Git when to make a commit of your own changes in the local repository.\n",
    "2. Tell Git when to send your new commits to the remote GitHub repository.\n",
    "3. Tell Git when to retrieve any new changes (that others made) from the remote GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will discuss all three of these steps in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Committing changes to a local repository {#commit-changes}\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on files in your local version control \n",
    "repository (e.g., using Jupyter) and saving your work, these changes will only initially exist in the\n",
    "working directory of the local repository (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc2-changes)).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc2-changes, fig.cap = 'Local repository with changes to files.', fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "image_read(\"img/vc2-changes.png\") |>\n",
    "  image_crop(\"3632x2000\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you reach a point that you want Git to keep a record \n",
    "of the current version of your work, you need to commit \n",
    "(i.e., snapshot) your changes. A prerequisite to this is telling Git which\n",
    "files should be included in that snapshot. We call this step **adding** the \n",
    "files to the **staging area**. \\index{git!add, staging area}\n",
    "Note that the staging area is not a real physical location on your computer; \n",
    "it is instead a conceptual placeholder for these files until they are committed.\n",
    "The benefit of the Git version control system using a staging area is that you \n",
    "can choose to commit changes in only certain files. For example, \n",
    "in Figure \\@ref(fig:vc-ba2-add), we add only the two files \n",
    "that are important to the analysis project (`analysis.ipynb` and `README.md`)\n",
    "and not our personal scratch notes for the project (`notes.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc-ba2-add, fig.cap = 'Adding modified files to the staging area in the local repository.', fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",

    "  image_crop(\"3632x1200\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the files we wish to commit have been added \n",
    "to the staging area, we can then commit those files to the repository history (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc-ba3-commit)).\n",
    "When we do this, we are required to include a helpful *commit message* to tell \n",
    "collaborators (which often includes future you!) about the changes that were\n",
    "made. In Figure \\@ref(fig:vc-ba3-commit), the message is `Message about changes...`; in \n",
    "your work you should make sure to replace this with an\n",
    "informative message about what changed. It is also important to note here that\n",
    "these changes are only being committed to the local repository's history.  The\n",
    "remote repository on GitHub has not changed, and collaborators would not yet be\n",
    "able to see your new changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc-ba3-commit, fig.cap = \"Committing the modified files in the staging area to the local repository history, with an informative message about what changed.\", fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",

    "  image_crop(\"3632x1100\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushing changes to a remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have made one or more commits that you want to share with your collaborators, \n",
    "you need \\index{git!push} to **push** (i.e., send) those commits back to GitHub (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc5-push)). This updates \n",
    "the history in the remote repository (i.e., GitHub) to match what you have in your \n",
    "local repository. Now when collaborators interact with the remote repository, they will be able\n",
    "to see the changes you made. And you can also take comfort in the fact that your work is now backed \n",
    "up in the cloud!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc5-push, fig.cap = 'Pushing the commit to send the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.', fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",

    "version control the changes you make on your local computer so that they exist \n",
    "both locally and remotely. In sum, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add** changes to the local staging area\n",
    "2. **Commit** changes to the local version control history\n",

    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling changes from a remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working on a project with collaborators, they will also be making changes to files\n",
    "(e.g., to the analysis code in a Jupyter notebook and the project's README file),\n",
    "committing them to their own local repository, and pushing their commits to the remote GitHub repository\n",
    "to share them with you. When they push their changes, those changes will only initially exist in \n",
    "the remote GitHub repository and not in your local repository (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc6-remote-changes)).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r vc6-remote-changes, fig.cap = 'Changes pushed by collaborators, or created directly on GitHub will not be automatically sent to your local repository.', fig.retina = 2, out.width=\"100%\"}\n",

    "  image_crop(\"3632x2000\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the new changes from the remote repository on GitHub, you will need\n",
    "to **pull** \\index{git!pull} those changes to your own local repository.  By pulling changes,\n",
    "you synchronize your local repository to what is present on GitHub (Figure \\@ref(fig:vc7-pull)).\n",
    "Additionally, until you pull changes from the remote repository, you will not\n",
    "be able to push any more changes yourself (though you will still be able to\n",
    "work and make commits in your own local repository). \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with remote repositories using GitHub \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have been introduced to some of the key general concepts \n",
    "and workflows of Git version control, we will walk through the practical steps. \n",
    "There are several different ways to start using version control\n",
    "with a new project. For simplicity and ease of setup, \n",
    "we recommend creating a remote repository \\index{repository!remote} first.\n",
    "This section covers how to both create and edit a remote repository on \\index{GitHub} GitHub.\n",
    "Once you have a remote repository set up, we recommend **cloning** (or copying) that \\index{git!clone} \n",
    "repository to create a local repository in which you primarily work.\n",
    "You can clone the repository either\n",
    "on your own computer or in a workspace on a server (e.g., a JupyterHub server).\n",
    "Section \\@ref(local-repo-jupyter) below will cover this second step in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a remote repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can create remote repositories on GitHub, \n",
    "you will need a GitHub account; you can sign up for a free account \n",
    "at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).\n",
    "Once you have logged into your account, you can create a new repository to host \n",
    "your project by clicking on the \"+\" icon in the upper right-hand \n",
    "corner, and then on \"New Repository,\" as shown in \n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:new-repository-01).\n",

    "Repositories can be set up with a variety of configurations, including a name, \n",
    "optional description,  and the inclusion (or not) of several template files. \n",
    "One of the most important configuration items to choose is the visibility to the outside world,\n",
    "either public or private. *Public* repositories \\index{repository!public} can be viewed by anyone.\n",

    "\n",
    "The beginning of the merge\n",
    "conflict is preceded by `<<<<<<< HEAD` and the end of the merge conflict is \n",

    "(`=======`). The version of the change before the separator is your change, and \n",
    "the version that follows the separator was the change that existed on GitHub.\n",
    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:merge-conflict-05), you can see that in your local repository\n",
    "there is a line of code that calls `scale_color_manual` with three color values (`deeppink2`, `cyan4`, and `purple1`).\n",
